/speckit.specify  a web app of equivalent of Google Calendar interface BUT with flexible APIs for further feature implementation , such as :  building a timetable management system, building a sick leave management system, building an appointment / booking management system

- /client:
  vite
  react.js
  shadcn (Javascript)

- /server:
    study the existing node/express/sequelize codebase I have provided to you and refactor it to fit the new calendar application requirements

- The interface, look & feel, interactivity should be up to par with  Google Calendar UI/UX experience
- The data should support multiple calendars, multiple users, sharing calendars between users, permission management (view only, edit, admin)
